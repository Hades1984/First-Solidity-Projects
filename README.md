# My First Solidity Projects ðŸ§ 

This repository contains my early Solidity smart contracts, written while learning.

## ðŸ“œ Contracts Included

- `demographic.sol`  
  A basic script that ask a user to set value to a three variables (name,age and social security) and then show them in a array as a result

- `etherprice.sol`  
  A simple calculator that ask for ETH balance and it's price and then calculate the value.

- `getbalance.sol`  
  Ask a user for an address and then get the balance.

- `CryptoZombie-Lesson 1.sol`  
  it's the code that I right for chapter 1 in basic course of Solidity on CryptoZombies.io.
  There is a link below that can show the web app result. Type a name and get a unique zombie based on the name.

- 'GuildProject.sol'
  It is a smart contract that allows the management of a guild with players. It enables functionalities such as registering players, leveling them up, managing roles (Admin and Member), and allowing members to leave the guild
  This contract includes role-based access control, ensuring that only the admin can perform certain critical actions, such as registering players and changing the admin role.
- 'QuestBoard.sol'
  QuestBoard allows users to create, claim, and complete quests with rewards. It's a minimal prototype for a decentralized task board, useful for bounties, collaborative tasks, or gamified missions.
  Key features:
     -Create Quest: Anyone can create a quest with a description and reward.
     -Claim Quest: Only non-creators can claim a quest if it's still available.
     -Mark Completion: Only the quest creator can mark the quest as completed.
     -Claim Rewards: Once marked complete, the claimer can receive the reward.
  No external libraries required. Events are emitted for quest creation, claiming, and completion.




### ðŸ“š Learning Goals

- Understand Solidity syntax
- Practice state variables and functions
- Use Remix IDE and GitHub for version control
