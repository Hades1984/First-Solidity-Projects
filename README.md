# My First Solidity Projects ðŸ§ 

This repository contains my early Solidity smart contracts, written while learning.

## ðŸ“œ Contracts Included

- `demographic.sol`  
  A basic script that ask a user to set value to a three variables (name,age and social security) and then show them in a array as a result

- `etherprice.sol`  
  A simple calculator that ask for ETH balance and it's price and then calculate the value.

- `getbalance.sol`  
  Ask a user for an address and then get the balance.

- `CryptoZombie-Lesson 1.sol`  
  it's the code that I right for chapter 1 in basic course of Solidity on CryptoZombies.io.
 

- `GuildProject.sol`
  It is a smart contract that allows the management of a guild with players.

  
- `QuestBoard.sol`
  QuestBoard allows users to create, claim, and complete quests with rewards. It's a minimal prototype for a decentralized task board, useful for bounties, collaborative tasks, or gamified missions.

  




### ðŸ“š Learning Goals

- Understand Solidity syntax
- Practice state variables and functions
- Use Remix IDE and GitHub for version control
